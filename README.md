## PHASE I: IDEATION
### Prospectus - 

This project concerns real estate market trends. 
The central focus of this project is to depict the current state of the real estate market. I intend to illustrate the narrative that the real estate market in the recent months has been "hot." I plan present visuals that support that idea; for example, showing timeseries of the median list prices, days from 'for sale' to 'pending', etc. 
Its intended audience is the general public, with special interest to aspiring home owners, real estate investors, and real estate professionals. 
Realtor.com provides Real Estate Data through their website: https://www.realtor.com/research/data/, this project will utilize those data. The data in its downloaded state is not ready-for-use and will need to be wrangled. The goal of the project is to provide a snapshot of the current real estate market relative to recent historial trends.
